**Dashboard Elements**

*Left center page* **Credit Ceiling**<br> 
Historic time series comparison of monthly outstanding balances (green columns) to montly turnover (blue columns) and currently approved credit ceiling (red line). When the outstanding balance exceeds the current approved credit ceiling, an SAP R/3 InfoCube includes this in the daily report, and the client is invited to pay the outstanding balance before shopping for more materials.<br>
*Utility:* If monthly turnover regularly exceeds the currently approved credit ceiling, the company can offer the client to increase the approved credit. If monthly turnover is regularly lower than the currently approved credit ceiling, the company can offer the client to release some of the collateral and decrease the approved credit.
